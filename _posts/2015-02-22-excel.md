This is one of my biggest gripes about economists. It is
[not](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_in_a_Time_of_Debt#Methodological_flaws)
[at
all](https://github.com/jtleek/capitalIn21stCenturyinR/tree/master/Piketty2014FiguresTables)
[uncommon](http://global.oup.com/uk/orc/busecon/economics/carlin_soskice/student/excelsimulator/)
that macroeconomists publish their data and their models as Excel files. But it
is not just economists! The Argonne National Laboratory's [GREET life-cycle
model](https://greet.es.anl.gov/) for total environmental impact of various transportation tradeoffs
basically amounts to an Excel spreadsheet.

## What is wrong with using Excel

Now, don't get me wrong: Excel is an *excellent* product. Indeed, I would rank Excel and Word up
there with two of the best and most important pieces of consumer software ever written. And for
initial modeling tasks, it can be an exceedingly valuable tool to get your creative juices flowing
and can even handle various complex modeling tasks. It is especially useful for keeping track
of a small number of cash flows and combining that data.

However, Excel is fundamentally limited. Last I checked, each sheet was limited to 65,536 rows,
which is not nearly enough for some of the data you expect to get about economic indicators.
(For instance, it is only about 22.5 years worth of hourly stock price values, assuming an
eight-hour trading day and no overnight trading.)

Moreover, it is fundamentally *limiting*. In particular, the fact that you can "see" your data
is a major impediment to the necessary abstraction you have to do to work with large amounts of
data. Even if you have only 1000 rows, you are not going to look at every value! You are going
to look at a few summary statistics--max, min, mean, median, standard deviation--and maybe a
couple plots. But I guarantee that you will spend some crazy amount of time scrolling up and
down the page pretending like you can divine patterns from the raw data. You cannot if for no
other reason that without seeing the global picture, e.g., via plotting, you will be tempted to
make hypotheses and simply find confirming evidence in the raw data.

Also, the format is not *open*. Well, [it technically
is](http://download.microsoft.com/download/D/3/3/D334A189-E51B-47FF-B0E8-C0479AFB0E3C/[MS-XLSX].pdf),
but that spec is 300 pages long. As a result, most non-Microsoft readers mangle the formulas and
make figuring out which data are important nearly impossible. And the Microsoft reader is $6.99
a month.

## How is this different from Word

While I personally hate receiving Word documents (another open format with a
(massive
specification)[http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm]),
my displeasure is relatively tempered. At most, with my non-Microsoft viewer, I
might have some strange rendering issues, but in general the data will be
there. Moreover, Microsoft themselves actually provides a [free
reader](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=4) that works
pretty well! (At least on Windows machines.) And if the other party is using
the online Office 365, there is actually an [online
viewer](http://blogs.office.com/2013/04/10/office-web-viewer-view-office-documents-in-a-browser/)
that works relatively well.

Indeed, the same is true for [Excel](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=10)!
Both an online and an offline viewer that work pretty well. So what is the problem?

The problem is that when I open an Excel file, I am not just going to read the data (see above).
In order to get a handle on what the data is saying, I am necessarily going to have to manipulate
it. I am going to change a few numbers and see how your charts change, or I am going to verify that
your formulas seem to do what you say they do. These are the basics of working with data.

That is, I cannot simply *view* the contents of an Excel file, I *must* manipulate them. So viewers
are, essentially, useless.

## The solution

Thus, the first step when I see an Excel file is to manhandle the data out of it and then to try
piecing the formulas back together in a more open way.

The alternative, which would make everyone's life easier, is simply to present the data in any
standard format, for instance, CSV or JSON, and then providing actual written documentation on the
data and its format.

But that's the easy part: simply presenting the raw data. The hard part is
presenting the manipulations. Personally, I think that anyone who wants to
publish their models and be taken seriously should switch to a more open
language. I would accept an [IPython notebook](http://www.ipython.org) using
the [standard](http://www.numpy.org) [scientific](http://matplotlib.org/)
[libraries](http://pandas.pydata.org/), [Roxygened](http://roxygen.org/) [R
scripts](http://www.r-project.org/), or even basic MATLAB (no toolkits so it
can be run with [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/)) or
[Julia](http://julialang.org/) (a newcomer to the party) or anything else that
I can download for free.

Of course, all these tools require some training, but the additional power they lend for
doing more interesting models should more than make up for it. Moreover, using open languages
and formats like this for data manipulation is good for the community as more people can
easily access the data and models. Finally, any of these tools actually helps *document*
a process: In Excel the order of functions and macros is completely nontransparent and how
a reader should even begin to approach them is impossible. On the other hand, a full-featured
programming language which allows for some sort of structured text comments (e.g., any of the
solutions mentioned above) solves that problem by its very nature.

## The point

Excel is great. But if you are sharing your models and your data, use something that everybody
can open and which self-evidently reveals how you approached the data.
